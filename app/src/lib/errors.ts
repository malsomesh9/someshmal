/**
 * Any error value -> searchable text. Handles the three real shapes: Error
 * instances (message + optional logs), strings, and PLAIN OBJECTS — the last
 * one because web3.js's confirmTransaction REJECTS with the bare
 * TransactionError object (e.g. {"InstructionError":[0,{"Custom":6026}]})
 * whenever the websocket signature-notification wins its internal race
 * against the polling path. String(err) on that object is "[object Object]",
 * which silently defeated the code extraction below — found live by the
 * Phase D browser proof's deliberate slippage-revert step, where the panel
 * showed "[object Object]" instead of the 6026 message. JSON.stringify is
 * the fix, and it applies to every panel (the ER panel had the same latent
 * race — never observed only because its on-chain failures happened to
 * surface through the resolved path or at send time).

/**
 * Detects the "wrong ledger" failure class specific to ER-fast trading
 * (docs/ER_TRADING_DESIGN.md §3): a transaction sent to the endpoint that no
 * longer (or doesn't yet) hold this account's authoritative state. Returns
 * a clear, actionable message when detected, or null if this doesn't look
 * like that — callers should fall back to `friendlyError` in that case.
 *
 * Three real, distinct shapes, all observed live during Phase 0/1 testing:
 *  1. Sent to the ER for an account that isn't (or is no longer) delegated
 *     there. The ER rejects this at the validator level, before program
 *     logic even runs — confirmed live: "InvalidAccountForFee" as the
 *     confirmTransaction err, with the log line "Feepayer ... was modified
 *     without being delegated", and `solana confirm` against the ER prints
 *     "This account may not be used to pay transaction fees".
 *  1b. Same class, different Solana runtime TransactionError variant:
 *     "InvalidWritableAccount" — observed live in the self-audit pass by
 *     racing a real out-of-band undelegate against a still-open browser tab
 *     whose cached router response hadn't caught up yet, then clicking
 *     Cancel. The ER rejected the write with this exact string (not
 *     InvalidAccountForFee that time), and since it wasn't in either
 *     pattern below it fell all the way through to friendlyError's raw
 *     fallback — a real "Transaction <sig> failed: ..." string overflowed
 *     the error box in the UI. Confirmed distinct enough (never seen outside
 *     this scenario) to intercept alongside case 1's message.
 *  2. Sent to base for an account that's STILL delegated (so base's copy is
 *     zeroed and owned by the Delegation Program, not this program) —
 *     surfaces as OnyxError::InvalidOwner (7001) from this program's own
 *     `is_owned_by(program_id)` checks in open_trading_account.rs /
 *     deposit_trading.rs / delegate_trading_account.rs / withdraw_trading.rs.
 *     Deliberately NOT intercepting 6006 (WrongStatus) here even though it
 *     COULD also stem from a ledger race — that code is reused for many
 *     unrelated "market isn't in the right state" conditions (e.g. a
 *     perfectly normal "already settled"), so masking all of them under a
 *     ledger-specific message would be actively misleading more often than
 *     it would help; its existing generic message already covers this case
 *     reasonably.
