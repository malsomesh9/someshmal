/**
 * Drop-in replacements for `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`'s `useWallet()` and
 * `useConnection()`, backed by the Phantom Connect embedded wallet.
 *
 * Why a shim rather than calling the Phantom SDK directly at each call site:
 * this app submits owner-signed transactions to TWO different clusters — the
 * Solana base layer AND the MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollup. Phantom's
 * `signAndSendTransaction` submits via Phantom's own infrastructure, and its
 * `switchNetwork` only accepts "mainnet" | "devnet", so it can never reach the
 * ER endpoint. We therefore sign with `signTransaction` and submit the raw
 * bytes ourselves through whichever `Connection` the caller passes — which is
 * exactly the `sendTransaction(tx, connection)` contract wallet-adapter
 * already had, so existing call sites keep working unchanged.
