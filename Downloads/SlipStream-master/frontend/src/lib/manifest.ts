// Resolves the on-chain addresses the frontend needs (program ID, SOL-PERP
// market, and orderbook) from the Deploy_Manifest emitted by scripts/deploy.ts.
//
// Resolution strategy (Requirement 6.2):
//   1. NEXT_PUBLIC_* environment variables, when set (build-time injection).
//   2. The deploy.json manifest copied into the package at build time by
//      scripts/copy-manifest.mjs (see predev/prebuild in package.json).
//
// Missing-manifest handling (Requirement 6.3):
//   If the real deploy.json was not found at build time AND no NEXT_PUBLIC_*
//   override is supplied for a required address, the manifest is considered
//   missing. resolveAddress() throws a descriptive error naming exactly what is
//   missing, and `manifestError` carries a human-readable message that the UI
//   surfaces as a visible banner. A last-known-good fallback keeps the build
//   green in CI without a deploy.json (see scripts/copy-manifest.mjs).
