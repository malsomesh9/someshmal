/// close_user_account
///
/// Closes the caller's `UserAccount` PDA and refunds the rent to the owner. Only
/// permitted when the user has zero state across the protocol:
///   - `free_collateral == 0`
///   - `reserved_margin == 0`
///   - `pending_fills == 0`
///   - no open Position on any market (see below)
///
/// Any TradingCredit accounts owned by this user must be closed independently
/// (via `withdraw_trading_credit` to drain credit, then their rent stays in the
/// PDA — closing them is a separate instruction we don't ship in MVP because
/// re-creating costs the same rent and the trade-off isn't worth a new instruction).
///
/// Accounts:
///   [0] user_account (W)
///   [1] owner        (signer)
///   [2] global_state (R)       — for market_count, so every market gets checked
///   [3..] exactly `market_count` Position PDAs, one per market index in order
///         (0, 1, 2, ...), each either not yet created (`data_is_empty()`) or
///         fully closed (`Position.size == 0`).
///
/// The three field checks above were the ONLY gate before this fix, and none of
/// them catch an open position: `reserved_margin` is never incremented anywhere
/// in the program (permanently 0 — dead code, kept here only for layout/ABI
/// stability), `free_collateral` is naturally 0 once margin has moved into a
/// position via `fund_trading_credit`, and `pending_fills` is 0 as soon as the
/// keeper settles. A user could close their UserAccount while holding an
/// arbitrarily underwater open position: `liquidate_position` requires a live
/// UserAccount whose `owner` matches the position's, so with it purged (and only
/// the owner able to recreate it, since `initialize_user` requires the owner's
/// signature) the position becomes permanently unliquidatable — a free option
/// where a recovery lets the owner reopen the account and bank the gain, and a
/// loss is stranded on the counterparty/insurance fund. The Position accounts
/// are MANDATORY (not scanned from optional trailing accounts) precisely because
/// an optional scan is trivially bypassed by simply not passing the account —
/// the same class of gap `withdraw_collateral`'s same-slot guard has.
