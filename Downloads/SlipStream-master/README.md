## What it is

Slipstream is an **on-chain perpetual-futures exchange** built around a **central-limit
order book (CLOB)** — the same price-time-priority matching model real exchanges use,
not an AMM. It tracks **SOL/USD** with leverage up to 20×, funding, and liquidations.

The hard problem it solves: a real CLOB needs thousands of fast, cheap order updates,
which Solana's base layer (L1) can't host directly — but L1 *can* custody money safely.
Slipstream **splits the system**:

- **Order matching** runs inside a [MagicBlock](https://www.magicblock.gg/) **Ephemeral
  Rollup (ER)** at ~10 ms — fast, sponsored, ideal for high-frequency quoting.
- **All value-bearing state** (collateral, positions, the token vault, funding) stays on
  **Solana L1**, where it is never delegated and therefore never at risk from the ER.

> **The one safety fact that matters:** delegation to the ER is capped, not unlimited.
> The 612 KB **OrderBook** (non-financial — order metadata only) is delegated forever.
> The only value-bearing account that's ever delegated is **TradingCredit** — a
> per-market allowance the user explicitly funds and caps (`fund_trading_credit`),
> never their whole balance. `UserAccount.free_collateral`, `Position`, and the token
> vault stay on L1 and are never delegated. A misbehaving ER can at worst scramble
> order *ordering* or misuse a session's capped credit allowance — it can never reach
> the vault or a user's un-delegated balance.

## What it does

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Limit + market orders, price-time-priority matching in the ER |  live |
| Margin × leverage (up to 20×), real notional/PnL accounting |  live |
| ER → L1 settlement into real `Position` accounts (FillLog pipeline) |  live |
| Partial close + slippage-bounded close-at-market |  live |
| Stop-loss / take-profit trigger orders (keeper-executed on-chain) |  live, keeper-cranked |
| Funding rate (8h interval, self-computed 30-min TWAP) |  live, keeper-cranked |
| Liquidations (health factor, liq price) |  live, keeper-cranked |
| Session keys (sign once, trade many — no popup per order) |  live |
| Live Pyth price chart (SSE stream + real OHLC history) |  live |
| Settled-trade history + system-status panel (SQLite fills indexer) |  live |
| On-chain order book held in a single ~612 KB PDA |  live |
| CI (clippy `-D warnings`, mollusk program tests, tsc + eslint) |  green |

- **Program** (`programs/`): written in **Pinocchio** (minimal, zero-dep Solana SDK).
  The 612 KB order book is one flat `#[repr(C)]`/`Pod` account read via **zero-copy**
  slices and grown in 10 KB chunks (Solana's per-CPI growth cap). 40 instructions,
  including keeper-executed SL/TP triggers and a mark-price freshness gate that
  refuses to settle closes off a stale/dead price feed.
- **Settlement** (`FillLog` pipeline): because the 612 KB book can't be committed to L1
  (size cap + a verified 10-commit-per-account limit), a tiny ~8 KB epoch-rotatable
  FillLog carries fills L1-ward: `mirror_fills` (ER) → `commit_fill_log` (ER→L1) →
  `settle_from_log` (L1). The book stays delegated forever, never committed.
- **Client SDK** (`client/`): PDA derivation, account decoders, instruction builders.
- **Keepers** (`keepers/`): off-chain bots that crank funding, liquidation, TWAP, expiry,
  and the settlement pipeline.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): Next.js app; routes all RPC through same-origin proxies to
  avoid CORS and stream live Pyth prices.

📖 **Full technical deep-dive:** [`docs/`](./docs/README.md) — 8 docs covering the
architecture, PDA storage, ephemeral rollups, the settlement pipeline, margin/funding/
liquidation math, session keys, the problems-and-solutions tour, and a glossary.

## Try it

The fastest way is the live demo at **[slipstream.ansht.tech](https://slipstream.ansht.tech)**.
You'll need a Solana wallet (Phantom/Solflare/Backpack) set to **devnet**. See
[**New-user walkthrough**](#new-user-walkthrough) below for the exact click path
(get devnet SOL → deposit test USDC → fund credit → delegate to the ER → trade).

## Run / check locally

### Prerequisites
- Node 20+, a Solana wallet on **devnet**.
- (Only to rebuild the on-chain program: Rust + Solana CLI + `cargo build-sbf`.)

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```
The build reads live on-chain addresses from the committed `deploy.json` (copied into the
app by `scripts/copy-manifest.mjs`). No env vars are required to run against the live
devnet deployment. To point at a different RPC, set `BASE_RPC_UPSTREAM` / `ER_RPC_UPSTREAM`
(see [`frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md)).

### Verify functionality
```bash
# Program: lint + unit/mollusk tests (build the .so first — the mollusk tests
# execute the real compiled program). This is exactly what CI runs (see
# .github/workflows/ci.yml) — the two -A flags are intentional, not omitted:
# clippy::too-many-arguments trips on a few internal helpers that are clearer
# flat than split, and unexpected_cfgs is pinocchio's own entrypoint! macro
# expansion, not this crate's code.
cargo clippy -p slipstream --locked -- -D warnings -A clippy::too-many-arguments -A unexpected_cfgs
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/slipstream/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path programs/slipstream/Cargo.toml --locked  # math/oracle unit tests
cargo test --manifest-path tests/unit/Cargo.toml --locked           # mollusk tests

# Frontend production build (type-checks + compiles)
cd frontend && npm run build
```

### Keepers (optional, for a self-hosted deployment)
```bash
cd keepers
cp .env.example .env       # set BASE_RPC / ER_RPC / KEEPER_KEYPAIR
npm install
npm run funding            # or: liquidation · twap · expiry · fill-log-keeper
```

### On-chain addresses (devnet)
Source of truth is [`deploy.json`](./deploy.json). Current deployment:

| | Address |
|---|---|
| Program | `7qujfsb4ZPbQHYVZdqiXq1r8tVAMyyukX94obPqXbVwz` |
| Market (SOL-PERP) | `ECUp8pXzVLzxjVs8mtKBJma3mdcHf8zSC4cqPeBy8MPy` |
| OrderBook | `83zMFL6cHjgXkQ7KRNcgtHaZ1fhyNgxhM8aMpPpEnMqe` |
| Pyth SOL/USD feed | `7UVimffxr9ow1uXYxsr4LHAcV58mLzhmwaeKvJ1pjLiE` |

## New-user walkthrough

Exactly what a brand-new user does to go from an empty wallet to a live trade. Everything
is **devnet** — no real money. (This is also the deposit/credit/ER flow end-to-end.)

1. **Wallet on devnet.** Install Phantom/Solflare/Backpack and switch the network to
   **Devnet** (Phantom: Settings → Developer Settings → Change Network → Devnet).
2. **Get devnet SOL** (pays transaction fees). Use a faucet:
   [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com) or `solana airdrop 2 <your-address> --url devnet`.
   A small amount (~0.5 SOL) is plenty.
3. **Open the app** at [slipstream.ansht.tech](https://slipstream.ansht.tech) and click
   **Connect Wallet** (top right) → approve.
4. **Get test USDC.** The demo USDC is a devnet mint controlled by the operator. New
   wallets are funded with test USDC for the demo — if your balance is 0, ping the
   operator to mint you some (the mint authority drips USDC to demo wallets). This USDC is
   worthless test tokens, used only to post margin.
5. **Deposit + Init** (Trading Session panel, right column → scroll down). Enter an amount
   (e.g. `1000`) and click **Deposit + Init**. This moves USDC from your wallet into the
   protocol vault on **L1** and creates your trading-credit account. *(One wallet signature.)*
6. **Fund credit.** Enter how much of your deposited collateral to allocate to SOL-PERP
   (e.g. `500`) and click **Fund credit**. This earmarks margin for this market.
7. **Delegate to ER.** Click **Delegate to ER (start trading)**. This delegates your
   *trading-credit* (a scoped margin allowance — not your whole balance) to the Ephemeral
   Rollup so orders match at sub-second speed. *(One wallet signature.)*
8. **(Recommended) Create a session key.** Once delegated, click **Rotate session key**.
   This authorizes an in-browser key to sign orders for you — **no wallet popup per
   order**. It's scoped to your capped credit and expires automatically.
9. **Trade.** Use the order form (left of the session panel): pick **Margin ($)**,
   **Leverage** (1–20×), and a **Limit price** or **Market**. The form derives your
   position size. Place the order — it matches in the ER instantly and shows as a pending
   position.
10. **Watch it settle.** A keeper mirrors your fill from the ER to L1 within a few seconds;
    your **Positions** table (below the fold, "Your Activity") then shows the real settled
    position with live PnL, health, and liquidation price. Close it any time to realize PnL
    back to your collateral, then withdraw.

> Money flow, in one line:
> `wallet USDC → deposit → collateral (L1) → fund → credit → delegate → ER → trade → settle → Position (L1)`.

### Additional devnet concessions

### Summary: what holds vs. what must change before mainnet

| Property | Devnet MVP (actual) | Required for mainnet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fund safety | OrderBook (non-financial) + a capped, user-funded TradingCredit allowance delegated; `free_collateral`/vault/Position never delegated | Same boundary, plus fraud proofs / verifier |
| Fraud proofs | None | Required |
| Oracle model | Pyth-only fallback (Switchboard dead) | True dual-oracle + divergence + restricted mode |
| Oracle account binding | Not validated against market feeds | Must assert passed account == market feed |
| Switchboard On-Demand sigs | Not verified | Must verify |
| ER environment | Devnet only | N/A (no mainnet ER endpoint) |
| TWAP | Self-computed on-chain accumulator | Same |
