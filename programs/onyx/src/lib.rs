//! ONYX on-chain settlement program (Pinocchio, native, no_std).
//!
//! L0 core MVP: escrow markets settled by a CPI into the `txoracle` program's
//! `validate_stat` instruction. Settlement truth is the on-chain Merkle root
//! posted by the oracle; ONYX never settles from off-chain data.
//!
//! The crate is `#![no_std]` on the Solana SBF target and `std` on the host so
//! the pure helpers (Merkle re-derivation, terms hashing, payout math) can be
//! unit-tested directly with `cargo test` on the host.
